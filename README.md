# Uber Data Cleaning
## Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing a raw dataset to make it suitable for analysis. Although the dataset is small, it serves as a demonstration of effective data-cleaning techniques. Specifically, we will work with an Uber dataset to clean the data and extract valuable insights to understand Uber trips better.
## Dataset

Description: The dataset contains 7 columns like 'start date', 'end date', 'start station', 'end station', 'category of the trip', 'miles', and 'purpose' and 1156 rows.
## Data Cleaning
- Utilized Jupyter Notebook with Python to clean the dataset.
- Addressed both missing values and subtle data inconsistencies.
- Applied various techniques to extract the most valuable insights from the dataset.
## Results
Developed a new dataset that is now clean, free of missing values and invalid data, and ready for analysis.
## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the importance of data cleaning in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of data analysis. The cleaned dataset is now ready for further analysis and visualization.
